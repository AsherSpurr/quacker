### ⭐️This is a work in progress in the very early stages!⭐️
### The goal of this project is not to save time but to learn a lot of new tech and concepts.

# What is the current progress?
- ✅ Build out a rudimentary front-end to get some experience with Next
- ✅ Create the database schema using drawsql
- ✅ Create all tables and functions necessary to the DB and seed with data
- 📍 Migrate front-end to fetch seeded data instead of placeholder data
- 📍 Circle back to front-end to add to and restructure as needed - adding some functionality
- 📍 Implement Redis once some functionality is in place
- ⭐️ Pause and assess the current state. Make decisions about CDN's, React Native, type of load balancing (since using Next), which AWS to use first, etc.
- 📍 Next steps based on this assessment 

# Why are we using certain tech?
The decision to use certain tech was purely based on learning goals.
Certain tech being used aren't the perfect pairing, but seamless pairing of tech wasn't the goal! This is why you may see the stack and go...what?

# Project Goals, learn a little about a lot - Twitter(x) clone 
- Use Next.js to gain experience with Server Side Rendering and better SEO
- Build out more complex databases using PostgreSQL
- Gain experience with serverless architecture
- Use React Native to explicitly make a mobile forward app
- Use Redis for its persistence and  replication 
- Migrate to use RDS for database management
- Migrate to Amazon's EC2 for improved scalability
- Learn about request throttling, caching, content delivery networks (CDN's), and load balancing
